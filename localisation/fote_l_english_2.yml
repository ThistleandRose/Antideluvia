help_decision.1.t:0 "Help Menu"
help_decision.1.desc:0 "Welcome to Rise of Civilization. This is a mod that blends EU4 and Civilizatin together, but it's overall goal is to simulate as realistically as possible the rise and fall of Civilizations. The world is uncolonized and it's up to you to bring Civilization to it, In addition, the terrain is your enemy, with modifiers reducing colonial growth to make a sort of dynamic wastelands. All provinces in the world start with "disorganized" culture, which just means there is no national identity, Animist religion, representing various local beliefs, and 3 development. Natives are strong, representing local lords tribes and city-states, and will need to be killed. There is a modifier that will nullify the effects of peaceful co-existence. As your nation grows, it will adapt a culture and religion. Later, the cultures and religions will split into sub-cultures and heresies (note the religious heresy stuff isn't really implemented yet). This is where the game truly begins, as you will soon be an "empire". At 3 stability and 90 legitimacy, you get a nice stable Empire modifier buff. Below that, and you start getting nastier nerfs depending on how unstable the empire is. Inflation and Corruption are different, inflation increases unrest, corruption increases unrest, but decreases the mana cost of everything (except tech) and makes estates more loyal, but also more influential. Basically, Corruption can help indirectly stabalize the realm, at the cost of an unhappier population. If your empire gets larger, you may have rebels pop up. The rebels, upon taking a province will be deleted and replaced with a nation-tag. If you end up in a "revolt war" with the new CB, provinces will be auto-annexed upon being occupied, as long as it's adjacent to a province the nation controls. So be careful, this could end the game. On the other hand, you can choose to play as the rebels, so unlike EU4 where you can't do anything and have to end the game if you either lose or grow too powerful, in Rise of Civilization and it's sister mod Fall of the Empire (both standalone and if paired together would actually be redundant) you can choose to continue the campaign, but as a different nation entirely, thus avoiding this Paradox (pun intended) where you can't lose, because the game ends, and you can't win or gro more powerful, because the game ends (or becomes boring anyways). In addition, there is a new food and plague mechanic, using devestation."

help_decision.1.f:0 "That will be all. (close help menu)"
help_decision.2.t:0 "Rebel mechanics!"
help_decision.2.d:0 "The Rebels in this mod are a tad bit different than EU4's. When a rebel occupies a province, it will cause a nation tag to appear and replace the rebels, assuming the rebels occupy it long enough. The event that fires when this happens will give you three choices, to leave them alone, declare war on them (you are the aggressor because otherwise allies get involved automatically as a defensive war) or you can choose to play as the rebels. In the Revolt War (a unique CB and wargoal added by this mod) both you and the enemy can auto-annex and get a territorial core on provinces that are occupied that are adjacent to a core you already own(to reduce bordergore). If you choose not to go to war with them, or if there is multiple successor states, you can for a few decades still declare a revolt war, depending on a few factors. Basically, two successor states (even from different empires, which is unavoidable due to how the event works. Please don't abuse) can declare war on each other, an empire (defined as a nation that had a revolt event fire) can declare war on successor states (and vice versa) but an "empire" can't declare a war on another empire with a revolt war with the special CB. This is to prevent gaming the system by purposefully having a revolt just to auto-annex another completely unrelated empire's land. For example, Rome has a revolt, Parthia has a revolt, but it makes no sense for Rome or Parthia respectively to be able to auto-annex Rome. Auto annexing is done via event, and will work if the attacker and defender are both the war leaders of the revolt war (special CB). You MUST be a war leader (IE the one declaring war or getting war declared on) for the auto-annex event to fire. Sorry if you can't declare war on a former part of your empire, because of how it's coded, but it's done like that in order to at least try and limit abusing of the system."

help_decision.3.t:0 "Empire Mechanics"
help_decision.3.d:0 "At the start of the game, you should have 1 province. IF you don't, either you have another mod active, or you are cheating somehow, anyways, with only a few provinces you are considered a city state, or a tribe, all the uncolonized provinces around you are basically city-states and tribes not important enough to be on the map, or doing so would ruin the point of the Civilization 4x style. The uncolonized are supposed to represent local tribes city-states etc. anyways, which is why it requires significant force to bring them into line. But you're not here for me rambling about that, you want to know about the empire mechanics, well when a subculture spawns, and you get 5 provinces not of your primary culture, you will get an Empire modifier. Large Empire is the default, it's not too bad, but it still slows you down. Stable Empire, achieved by 3 stability and 90 legitimacy, will give you some buffs actually, that aren't military related, Unstable Empire and Imperial Crisis are exactly what they sound, instability in the empire causes debuffs that are designed to kill empires, and specifically to make sure the players empire die. Muwhahaha. Inflation increases unrest, Corruption increases unrest but stabalizes the realm by reducing power costs (but not of technology) and increasing estate loyalty at the cost of estate influence, so be careful. RNG is implemented too, since you can re-start as a successor state, i can increase the effects of RNG and try to kill player empires since it won't necessarrily end the game. This is most obvious with the ruler. Having a ruler with high stats will help your nation and perhaps allow the empire to grow, while low stats will cripple or kill the empire. Specifically, having 5 ADM, DIP, or MIL skill will cause the buffs and less than 2 ADM DIP or MIL will cause debuffs. Primarily, Governing capacity is increased and decreased by these effects, and will cause unrest when you are over it. This means that to some extent, there is a soft hard cap on how big your empire can grow. Making territories instead of states will help a little bit, but not much compared to vanilla EU4. There are also some other debuffs, usually related to some aspect of the empire's failing to make bad problems get worse. For example, Over-extension can cause a debuff, negative prestige? that's a debuff, too much unrest from debuffs? That's gonna be another debuff. As long as you aren't too crazy you can weather the storm, but the purpose of all of this is to make it less about expanding an empire, and more so about delaying it's fall as much as possible."
help_decision.4.t:0 "Culture Mechanics"
help_decision.4.d:0 "There isnt much to say about this. The world starts disorganized, which means no national identity or shared customs and such, untill you adopt a culture and start colonising the world. Your nation will adopt a culture randomly and no, you don't have a say in it. when you have 10 provinces of your primary culture, the culture will split with a sub culture forming. This sub culture will expand a bit before a new one will appear (in theory, A GAME THEORY) When a nation splits off from the empire, it wll eventually found it's own culture group, and the process repeats. This will happen with Custom nations too, as it's based off event flags, since neither the starting civs nor custom nations have the event yet, it will fire. That means if you start with a culture you want to play as, you have to develop the culture's provinces to 20 then culture switch via normal EU4 mechanics."
help_decision.5.t:0 "Religion mechanics"
help_decision.5.d:0 "At the start of the game, everyone should be animist, unless you're cheatin again. I'm on to you. You will be animist untill eventually your nation will get an event to adopt a religion, which you get randomly. there is a religious heirarchy in place, Animism is on the bottom, Unreformed pagans are next, followed by primitive organized religion: (basically the religion that exists before heresies form) Zoroastrianism Judaism Confucianism Buddhism and Dharmic religions, and getting towards the top, organized religion: Early Christianity, Islam, both before they split up, (note, technically some of the religions in the step before this, primitive organized religion, won't be converted via event). At the very top we have the heresies and schisms of the former religions, in addition to Reformed Pagans, which will convert early christianity and Islam but not the schism and heresy varients, such as Catholicms Orthodoxy etc. You could argue that the very top is The Reformation, which i didn't touch. Pagan religions will get the ability to reform to a more organized varient, just like in Crusader Kings."

help_decision.6.t:0 "Food and Plagues"
help_decision.6.d:0 "In Rise of Civilization, devestation rises via development. This acts as a food mechanic using global devestation. Production increases food (decreases devestation) and development uses up food (IE increases devestation) In addition terrain produces food or uses up food, so farmlands and grasslands will be critical for building a civilization. In addition when devestation increases to a certain amount it will cause a famine, which will increase your entire civilization's devestation by a small amount and increases unrest. There are buildings (due to reaons i don't know, you can only see it in the macro build menu not the province view) that increase food (IE decrease devestation) In addition when a province gets too developed, it can cause a plague to start. Plagues reduce development and increase unrest. A plague will also spread to other provinces even foreign ones. After a plague has infected a province it won't be hit by plagues untill a certain amount of time. In addition you can Qurantine provinces to decrease the chance of a plague spreading."

Papal leadership, which doesn't mean a Pope per say but a Pope like figure that is outside your rulership. Grants more authority and thus more stability, but is costly, and makes the clergy loyal to outside forces. Maybe you are better off doing it yourself, Temporal means You are the Religion.
